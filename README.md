# 1 Billion Row Challenge

The [1 Billion Row Challenge](https://github.com/gunnarmorling/1brc) is a challenge of code optimization: "How fast can you parse 1 billion lines and compute some (simple) statistics on the contents of the file?"

This repo is intended to be a comparison of different approaches: a simple, stupid approach (`plain`)  and an optimized, performant approach (`performant`).
